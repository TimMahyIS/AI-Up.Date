JefPajot is seated between two men on a carriage in a historic European plaza. He looks content with a slight smile. His hair is short and neatly combed, and he has a well-trimmed beard. He wears a light green polo shirt with a small embroidered emblem. The background shows a busy square with beautiful old architecture, including arched windows and stone buildings.
